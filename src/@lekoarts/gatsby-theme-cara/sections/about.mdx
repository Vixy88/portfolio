## About

> Founder [RPAIR](https://www.rpair.co.uk) and Software Developer. I love coding and am currently working on up skilling myself with General Assembly's Software Engineering Course!

My passion has always been technology and in the last 3 years that has translated into a deep passion for coding and building software. I have completed several courses and projects on the side of my day to day jobs and I am now working as a developer and creating the career change I am so passionate about.
